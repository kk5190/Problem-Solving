# 93. Restore IP Addresses
To solve this problem, you can use a backtracking algorithm. Start by generating all possible combinations of the input string s by adding dots at different positions. Then, check if each combination is a valid IP address by checking if each segment of the IP address (separated by dots) is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and does not have leading zeros. If a combination is valid, add it to a list of valid IP addresses. Finally, return the list of valid IP addresses.

## What are the prerequisites of the problem?
The problem requires a basic understanding of IP addresses and their structure. An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It is a 32-bit number that is usually represented in the form of four integers separated by dots (e.g. 192.168.1.1).

Additionally, the problem requires a basic understanding of backtracking algorithms and how they can be used to generate all possible combinations of a given input string. Backtracking algorithms are a type of recursive algorithm that involve exploring all possible solutions by building up a solution incrementally and backtracking (i.e. undoing the last step) when a solution is found to be invalid.

It also requires the understanding of constraints, conditions and the scope of the problem.

In this problem, the scope is to return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. And the condition is that each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

## What are the approaches to solve this probelm?

There are several approaches to solve this problem, each with its own time and space complexity. Here are a few of them listed in decreasing order of time and space complexity:

**Backtracking**: As described in my previous answer, this approach involves generating all possible combinations of the input string s by adding dots at different positions and checking if each combination is a valid IP address. The time complexity of this approach is O(3^4) = O(81) as there are 4 dots and each dot can be placed at 3 different positions. The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.

**Brute Force**: This approach involves generating all possible substrings of the input string s and checking if each substring is a valid IP address segment (between 0 and 255 and without leading zeros). The time complexity of this approach is O(n^4) as there are n^4 possible substrings. The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not storing any intermediate results.

**Dynamic Programming**: This approach involves storing intermediate results in a 2D array and using them to generate the final solution. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) as we are storing the intermediate results in a 2D array. The space complexity of this approach is O(n^2) as we are storing the intermediate results in a 2D array.

**Greedy Algorithm**: This approach involves making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. The time complexity of this approach is O(n) as we are iterating through the input string only once. The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not storing any intermediate results.

It is worth mentioning that the time and space complexity of the algorithm depends on the implementation and it may not be possible to know the exact time and space complexity of the algorithm until it is implemented and tested.

## What is the most optimal approach and how its better than others?
The most optimal approach to solve this problem would be a Backtracking approach, because it has the best time and space complexity among the other approaches I've mentioned.

The time complexity of this approach is O(3^4) = O(81) as there are 4 dots and each dot can be placed at 3 different positions. The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.

This approach is better than the brute force approach because it's time complexity is O(3^4) while the brute force approach is O(n^4) which makes this approach faster when the input string is large.

This approach is also better than the dynamic programming approach because it's space complexity is O(n) while the dynamic programming approach is O(n^2) which makes this approach use less memory.

The greedy approach may have a better time complexity O(n) but it can't cover all the possible solutions and it's not guaranteed that the solution found is optimal.

In conclusion, backtracking approach is the most optimal approach because it has the best time and space complexity and it can cover all the possible solutions unlike the greedy approach.
