# Two Pointers

- A technique used to solve problems involving an iterable data structure (e.g. array)
- Uses two or more pointers that traverse through the structure
- The pointers can be physically separate or calculated from existing values (e.g. index)
- The function that uses the entries referenced by the two pointers relates to the answer
- The algorithm has these characteristics:
  - Two moving pointers (same or opposite direction)
  - Function that uses the entries referenced by the pointers
  - Easy way to decide which pointer to move
  - Process to follow when pointers are moved
- Classifications:
  - Same Directions
  - Opposite Directions
  - Sliding Window
  - Non-array Applications
- More efficient than naive solutions (e.g. two loops) with time complexity often O(n) instead of O(n^2)
